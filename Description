How to use Steg with description of example


As you know by now Steg has two parts, an input (the encoder) and an output (the decoder).  The encoder requires an image and a message, the decoder only needs an image which it will extract a message from.

ENCODER
Provide an image file (converted to a .txt file) with ARGB values in a newline separated list.  Then provide the message as a string that ends in a '#'.  The # denotes the end of the message.

For example the file could be called "image.txt" and should contain something like: 

fafcf9
fafcfb
f8fcfd
f8fdff
...

And the message could be as simple as "hey#"

The encoder will provide a new image/text file that can then be passed securely to the receiving party.

DECODER
You should now have an image/text file to use as input to the decoder portion of the program.  Send this to the decoder and it will create a new file with the hidden message inside.
