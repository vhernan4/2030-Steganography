ADT name: Steg

Steg is a steganography encoder and decoder.  It handles two files for input, an image and a message to be encoded.
The decoder portion will read an encoded image and extract the message from the image in a human-readable format.
The idea is to provide a way to pass encoded messages from one party to another.
